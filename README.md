# Complex and Social Networks 

### Facultat d'Informàtica de Barcelona (FIB) of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)

Lab assignments were developed in rotating pairs, as such, each lab was developed with a specific partner.
This was my first contact with the programming language R, and, as such, there is a clear improvement on code quality over time, so please disregard any ugly code you find.
